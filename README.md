# UmapFlow
Automatic MRD detection in pediatric AML patients with UMAP and HDBSCAN. 

Official implementation of our work: *"UMAP based anomaly detection for minimal residual disease quantification within acute myeloid leukemia"*
by Lisa Weijler, Florian Kowarsch, Matthias WÃ¶dlinger, Michael Reiter, Margarita Maurer-Granofszky, Angela Schumich and Michael Dworzak. 


## Usage
### Create virtual env and setup project
```shell
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install cython
$ pip install umap-learn
$ pip install hdbscan
$ python setup.py install
```

### Config file 

A template for the config file is given by  ``config/example-experiment.json``. It specifies where to load the data from, as well as the hyperparameters used for UMAP and HDBSCAN. The *data_loader* config stores the path to a folder containing *.txt files. In those *.txt files the paths to raw flow cytometry files are stored (e.g. see "data/example_experiment/train.txt or test.txt). Those files are preloaded and saved using pickle into a directory specified in "fast_preload_dir" (e.g. data/example_experiment/data_temp). If the fast preload directories already exist, the preloaded files are used directly. 

Here a few preloaded example files are given to test the repository. To load raw flowcytometry file we recommend using the package ``flowme``. 

### To run 

```shell
$ python main.py --config config/example_experiment.json
```
